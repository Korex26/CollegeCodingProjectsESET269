CLASS BACKGROUND INFORMATION
- ESET 269 Embedded Systems Development in C. 
- Credits 3. 2 Lecture Hours. 3 Lab Hours. 
- Introduction to programming using the C programming language and embedded microcontroller systems; fundamental language syntax and symantics, concentration of the application to embedded systems. 
- (ESET 269, Embedded Systems Development in C/ C++) Use of Visual Studio Code, Keil uVision5, Tera Term, and MSP432 microcontroller to perform coding assignments and projects in C. Topics included Variables, Printf/Scanf, If-Else, Switch, Loops, Math Operations, Relational Operations, Logic Operations, Arrays, Strings, Pointers, Functions, Structures, Header Files, MSP432 Overview, Bitwise Operations, Digital I/O, Timers, UART, and Embedded System Design. The final project involved creating a code sequence to measure and configure the inputs and outputs of a MSP432 controller including the LEDs, Buttons, and Internal Temp.
